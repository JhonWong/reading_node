## The Hacker Attitude

Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.

To follow the path:
​    look to the master,
​    follow the master,
​    walk with the master,
​    see through the master,
​    become the master.

So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until you believe them:

**1.The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.**

Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. To be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.

作为一名hacker是很有趣的事情，这种乐趣需要付出努力。努力需要动力。成为一名hacker要学会从解决问题、磨炼技能、锻炼智力中获取快感。这种快感会成为付出努力的动力。

如果不能找到这种感觉，那么你的精力将会被别的东西分散掉。

(You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.)

（遇到自己不能解决的问题的时候，就要从一小块入手，解决并从中学习到知识，然后开始下一块，依次直到问题解决。要学会拆分问题，然后一点一点的去解决问题）

**2.No problem should ever have to be solved twice.**

Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource.

创造性的大脑是珍贵的，不应该浪费在重复的事情中。

To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that it's almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve *new* problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.

其他hacker的思考时间是珍贵的，要学会分享信息，让其他的hacker可以有时间去思考新的问题。

Note, however, that "No problem should ever have to be solved twice." does not imply that you have to consider all existing solutions sacred, or that there is only one right solution to any given problem. Often, we learn a lot about the problem that we didn't know before by studying the first cut at a solution. It's OK, and often necessary, to decide that we can do better. What's not OK is artificial technical, legal, or institutional barriers (like closed-source code) that prevent a good solution from being re-used and *force* people to re-invent wheels.

确定我们是否可以做的更好也是很正常的。学习之前的解决方案很多时候也很有用。这往往会让我们了解到很多我们之前并没有考虑到的问题。

( It's fine to use your hacking skills to support a family or even get rich, as long as you don't forget your loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it.)

（只要不忘记hacker的这种基本的品质就好）

**3.Boredom and drudgery are evil.**

Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it means they aren't doing what only they can do — solve new problems. This wastefulness hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are not just unpleasant but actually evil.

hacker只会做有创造性的工作。

(There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will sometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer as a mind-clearing exercise, or in order to acquire a skill or have some particular kind of experience you can't have otherwise. But this is by choice — nobody who can think should ever be forced into a situation that bores them.)

**4.Freedom is good.**

Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being fascinated by — and, given the way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so. So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, lest it smother you and other hackers.

(This isn't the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to get something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that's a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not on offer.)

Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing — they only like ‘cooperation’ that they control. So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief.

被迫接受一些命令，并且放弃自己所迷恋的问题是有限度的。

**5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.**

To be a hacker, you have to develop some of these attitudes. But copping an attitude alone won't make you a hacker, any more than it will make you a champion athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will take intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.

态度不能取代能力。成为一名hacker同样需要除了态度外的很多别的东西。

If you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself — the hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than drudgery. That attitude is vital to becoming a hacker.

尊重能力。

## Basic Hacking Skills

The hacker attitude is vital, but skills are even more vital. Attitude is no substitute for competence, and there's a certain basic toolkit of skills which you have to have before any hacker will dream of calling you one.

态度很重要，技巧更重要。

**1. Learn how to program.**

If you don't know any computer languages, I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners.I think it is probably best to learn C and Lisp first, then Java.

If a language does too much for you, it may be simultaneously a good tool for production and a bad one for learning.It's not only languages that have this problem; web application frameworks like RubyOnRails, CakePHP, Django may make it too easy to reach a superficial sort of understanding that will leave you without resources when you have to tackle a hard problem, or even just debug the solution to an easy one.

如果一个语言为你做了太多的事情，那么这个语言就是一个强大的工具，但是不适合学习。

If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C;  Neither language is a good one to try learning as your first, however. And, actually, the more you can avoid programming in C the more productive you will be.

C is very efficient, and very sparing of your machine's resources. Unfortunately, C gets that efficiency by requiring you to do a lot of low-level management of resources (like memory) by hand. All that low-level code is complex and bug-prone, and will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging. With today's machines as powerful as they are, this is usually a bad tradeoff — it's smarter to use a language that uses the machine's time less efficiently, but your time much *more* efficiently. Thus, Python.

C语言对于机器来说是很高效的，但对于程序员来说就效率太低了。最好能选择一个对人来说高效的语言——Python.

Other languages of particular importance to hackers include [Perl](http://www.perl.com/) and [LISP](http://www.lisp.org/). Perl is worth learning for practical reasons; it's very widely used for active web pages and system administration, so that even if you never write Perl you should learn to read it. Many people use Perl in the way I suggest you should use Python, to avoid C programming on jobs that don't require C's machine efficiency. You will need to be able to understand their code.

LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot. (You can get some beginning experience with LISP fairly easily by writing and modifying editing modes for the Emacs text editor, or Script-Fu plugins for the GIMP.)

Perl 和LISP也很重要。对于Perl，至少要能读懂它。而LISP则具有很大的启蒙意义。

It's best, actually, to learn all five of Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP. Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways.

最好学会所有者五种语言。

But be aware that you won't reach the skill level of a hacker or even merely a programmer simply by accumulating languages — you need to learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language. To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know. This means you should learn several very different languages.

hacker的编程能力是独立于语言之外的。

**I can't give complete instructions on how to learn to program here — it's a complex skill. But I can tell you that books and courses won't do it — many, maybe *most* of the best hackers are self-taught. You can learn language features — bits of knowledge — from books, but the mind-set that makes that knowledge into living skill can be learned only by practice and apprenticeship. What will do it is (a) *reading code* and (b) *writing code*.**

书本和课程并不能教会编程技巧。读写代码才是真正的方法。

[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language. The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form, write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of strength and economy you see in your models.

多看一些大师的代码，然后写一些东西。

[How To Learn Hacking](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacking-howto.html)

**2. Get one of the open-source Unixes and learn to use and run it.**

The single most important step any newbie can take toward acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy of Linux or one of the BSD-Unixes, install it on a personal machine, and run it.

其他的操作系统的代码不可读，而且不可修改。

Unix is the operating system of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing Unix, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding Unix. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly Unix-centered.

不理解Unix操作系统就无法成为互联网黑客。

For more about learning Unix, see [The Loginataka](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html). You might also want to have a look at [The Art Of Unix Programming](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/).

The blog [Let's Go Larval!](https://letsgolarval.wordpress.com/) is a window on the learning process of a new Linux user that I think is unusually lucid and helpful. The post [How I Learned Linux](https://letsgolarval.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/how-i-learned-linux/) makes a good starting point.

To get your hands on a Linux, see the [Linux Online!](http://www.linux.org/) site; you can download from there or (better idea) find a local Linux user group to help you with installation.

You can find BSD Unix help and resources at [www.bsd.org](http://www.bsd.org/).

A good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up what Linux fans call a [live CD](http://www.livecdnews.com/), a distribution that runs entirely off a CD or USB stick without having to modify your hard disk. This may be slow, because CDs are slow, but it's a way to get a look at the possibilities without having to do anything drastic.

I have written a primer on the [basics of Unix and the Internet](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html).

**3. Learn how to use the World Wide Web and write HTML.**

This doesn't just mean learning how to drive a browser (anyone can do that), but learning how to write HTML, the Web's markup language. If you don't know how to program, writing HTML will teach you some mental habits that will help you learn. So build a home page.

But just having a home page isn't anywhere near good enough to make you a hacker. The Web is full of home pages. Most of them are pointless, zero-content sludge — very snazzy-looking sludge, mind you, but sludge all the same (for more on this see [The HTML Hell Page](http://catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html)).

垃圾的网页没有任何用处。

To be worthwhile, your page must have *content* — it must be interesting and/or useful to other hackers.

**4. If you don't have functional English, learn it.**

It was reported to me at the time that English has a richer technical vocabulary than any other language and is therefore simply a better tool for the job. For similar reasons, translations of technical books written in English are often unsatisfactory (when they get done at all).

丰富的专业词汇量是翻译面对的最大的问题

## Status in the Hacker Culture

Like most cultures without a money economy, hackerdom runs on reputation. You're trying to solve interesting problems, but how interesting they are, and whether your solutions are really good, is something that only your technical peers or superiors are normally equipped to judge.

只有与自己技术相当或比自己高水平的人才能判断自己的解决方案。

Accordingly, when you play the hacker game, you learn to keep score primarily by what other hackers think of your skill (this is why you aren't really a hacker until other hackers consistently call you one).

个人能力全在他人如何看待自己

Specifically, hackerdom is what anthropologists call a *gift culture*. You gain status and reputation in it not by dominating other people, nor by being beautiful, nor by having things other people want, but rather by giving things away. Specifically, by giving away your time, your creativity, and the results of your skill.

hacker文化就是一种分享的文化

There are basically five kinds of things you can do to be respected by hackers:

**1. Write open-source software**

The first (the most central and most traditional) is to write programs that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources away to the whole hacker culture to use.

(We used to call these works “free software”, but this confused too many people who weren't sure exactly what “free” was supposed to mean. Most of us now prefer the term “[open-source](http://www.opensource.org/)” software).

**2. Help test and debug open-source software**

If you're a newbie, try to find a program under development that you're interested in and be a good beta-tester(who know how to describe symptoms clearly, localize problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines). There's a natural progression from helping test programs to helping debug them to helping modify them. You'll learn a lot this way, and generate good karma with people who will help you later on.

**3. Publish useful information**

Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information into web pages or documents like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists, and make those generally available.

Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source authors.

**4. Help keep the infrastructure working**

The hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for that matter) is run by volunteers. There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous work that needs done to keep it going — administering mailing lists, moderating newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and other technical standards.

People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing with code. Doing them shows dedication.

**5. Serve the hacker culture itself**

## The Hacker/Nerd Connection

Contrary to popular myth, you don't have to be a nerd to be a hacker. It does help, however, and many hackers are in fact nerds. Being something of a social outcast helps you stay concentrated on the really important things, like thinking and hacking.

专注的人牺牲了自己思考社会关系的时间

If you can manage to concentrate enough on hacking to be good at it and still have a life, that's fine. This is a lot easier today than it was when I was a newbie in the 1970s; mainstream culture is much friendlier to techno-nerds now. There are even growing numbers of people who realize that hackers are often high-quality lover and spouse material.

If you're attracted to hacking because you don't have a life, that's OK too — at least you won't have trouble concentrating. Maybe you'll get a life later on.

## Points For Style

Again, to be a hacker, you have to enter the hacker mindset. There are some things you can do when you're not at a computer that seem to help. They're not substitutes for hacking (nothing is) but many hackers do them, and feel that they connect in some basic way with the essence of hacking.

电脑之外的个人风格

- Learn to write your native language well. Though it's a common stereotype that programmers can't write, a surprising number of hackers (including all the most accomplished ones I know of) are very able writers.

  写作

- Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions (a good way to meet hackers and proto-hackers).

- Join a hackerspace and make things (another good way to meet hackers and proto-hackers).

- Train in a martial-arts form. The kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do. The most hackerly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline, relaxed awareness, and precise control, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical toughness.

  纪律性

- Study an actual meditation discipline. The perennial favorite among hackers is Zen (importantly, it is possible to benefit from Zen without acquiring a religion or discarding one you already have). Other styles may work as well, but be careful to choose one that doesn't require you to believe crazy things.

  冥想

- Develop an analytical ear for music. Learn to appreciate peculiar kinds of music. Learn to play some musical instrument well, or how to sing.

- Develop your appreciation of puns and wordplay.

  学会贫嘴

The more of these things you already do, the more likely it is that you are natural hacker material. Why these things in particular is not completely clear, but they're connected with a mix of left- and right-brain skills that seems to be important; hackers need to be able to both reason logically and step outside the apparent logic of a problem at a moment's notice.

Work as intensely as you play and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between "play", "work", "science" and "art" all tend to disappear, or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness. Also, don't be content with a narrow range of skills. Though most hackers self-describe as programmers, they are very likely to be more than competent in several related skills — system administration, web design, and PC hardware troubleshooting are common ones. A hacker who's a system administrator, on the other hand, is likely to be quite skilled at script programming and web design. Hackers don't do things by halves; if they invest in a skill at all, they tend to get very good at it.

想游戏一样工作，像工作一样游戏。不要把自己限制在很窄的技术范围内。

Finally, a few things *not* to do.

- Don't use a silly, grandiose user ID or screen name.
- Don't get in flame wars on Usenet (or anywhere else).
- Don't call yourself a ‘cyberpunk’, and don't waste your time on anybody who does.
- Don't post or email writing that's full of spelling errors and bad grammar.

The problem with screen names or handles deserves some amplification. Concealing your identity behind a handle is a juvenile and silly behavior characteristic of crackers, warez d00dz, and other lower life forms. Hackers don't do this; they're proud of what they do and want it associated with their *real* names. So if you have a handle, drop it. In the hacker culture it will only mark you as a loser.

尽量使用真名。

## Frequently Asked Questions

| **Q:** | How do I tell if I am already a hacker?                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A:** | Ask yourself the following three questions:Do you speak code, fluently?  Do you identify with the goals and values of the hacker community?Has a well-established member of the hacker community ever called you a hacker? |

**Q:**Will you teach me how to hack?

**A:**Learn a few things first. Show that you're trying, that you're capable of learning on your own. Then go to the hackers you meet with specific questions.

If you do email a hacker asking for advice. We've found that people who are lazy or careless in their writing are usually too lazy and careless in their thinking to make good hackers — so take care to spell correctly, and use good grammar and punctuation, otherwise you'll probably be ignored.



**Q:**How can I get started, then?

**A:**The best way for you to get started would probably be to go to a LUG (Linux user group) meeting. You can find such groups on the [LDP General Linux Information Page](http://www.tldp.org/links/index.html); there is probably one near you, possibly associated with a college or university. LUG members will probably give you a Linux if you ask, and will certainly help you install one and get started.

Your next step (and your first step if you can't find a LUG nearby) should be to find an open-source project that interests you. Start reading code and reviewing bugs. Learn to contribute, and work your way in.

*The only way in is by working to improve your skills.* If you ask me personally for advice on how to get started, I will tell you these exact same things, because I don't have any magic shortcuts for you. I will also mentally write you off as a probable loser - because if you lacked the stamina to read this FAQ and the intelligence to understand from it that *the only way in is by working to improve your skills*, you're hopeless.

Another interesting possibility is to go visit a hackerspace. There is a burgeoning movement of people creating physical locations - maker's clubs - where they can hang out to work on hardware and software projects together, or work solo in a cogenial atmosphere. Hackerspaces often collect tools and specialized equipment that would be too expensive or logistically inconvenient for individuals to own. Hackerspaces are easy to find on the Internet; one may be located near you.

**Q:**How long will it take me to learn to hack?

**A:**That depends on how talented you are and how hard you work at it. Most people who try can acquire a respectable skill set in eighteen months to two years, if they concentrate. Don't think it ends there, though; in hacking (as in many other fields) it takes about ten years to achieve mastery. And if you are a real hacker, you will spend the rest of your life learning and perfecting your craft.

**Q:**Where can I find some real hackers to talk with?

**A:**The best way is to find a Unix or Linux user's group local to you and go to their meetings (you can find links to several lists of user groups on the [LDP](http://www.tldp.org/) site at ibiblio).

(I used to say here that you wouldn't find any real hackers on IRC, but I'm given to understand this is changing. Apparently some real hacker communities, attached to things like GIMP and Perl, have IRC channels now.)

**Q:**Can you recommend useful books about hacking-related subjects?

**A:**I maintain a [Linux Reading List HOWTO](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO/index.html) that you may find helpful. The [Loginataka](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/loginataka.html) may also be interesting.For an introduction to Python, see the [tutorial ](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html)on the Python site.

**Q:**Where can I get a free Unix?

**A:**If you don't have a Unix installed on your machine yet, elsewhere on this page I include pointers to where to get the most commonly used free Unix. To be a hacker you need motivation and initiative and the ability to educate yourself. Start now...

I think a good way to find out if you have what it takes is to pick up a copy of Raymond Smullyan's book *What Is The Name Of This Book?*. Smullyan's playful logical conundrums are very much in the hacker spirit. Being able to solve them is a good sign; *enjoying* solving them is an even better one.

In general, any language that isn't fully supported under at least Linux or one of the BSDs, and/or at least three different vendors' operating systems, is a poor one to learn to hack in.
