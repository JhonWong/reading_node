## The Hacker Attitude

Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.

To follow the path:
​    look to the master,
​    follow the master,
​    walk with the master,
​    see through the master,
​    become the master.

So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until you believe them:

**1.The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.**

Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. To be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.

作为一名hacker是很有趣的事情，这种乐趣需要付出努力。努力需要动力。成为一名hacker要学会从解决问题、磨炼技能、锻炼智力中获取快感。这种快感会成为付出努力的动力。

如果不能找到这种感觉，那么你的精力将会被别的东西分散掉。

(You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.)

（遇到自己不能解决的问题的时候，就要从一小块入手，解决并从中学习到知识，然后开始下一块，依次直到问题解决。要学会拆分问题，然后一点一点的去解决问题）

**2.No problem should ever have to be solved twice.**

Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource.

创造性的大脑是珍贵的，不应该浪费在重复的事情中。

To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that it's almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve *new* problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.

其他hacker的思考时间是珍贵的，要学会分享信息，让其他的hacker可以有时间去思考新的问题。

Note, however, that "No problem should ever have to be solved twice." does not imply that you have to consider all existing solutions sacred, or that there is only one right solution to any given problem. Often, we learn a lot about the problem that we didn't know before by studying the first cut at a solution. It's OK, and often necessary, to decide that we can do better. What's not OK is artificial technical, legal, or institutional barriers (like closed-source code) that prevent a good solution from being re-used and *force* people to re-invent wheels.

确定我们是否可以做的更好也是很正常的。学习之前的解决方案很多时候也很有用。这往往会让我们了解到很多我们之前并没有考虑到的问题。

( It's fine to use your hacking skills to support a family or even get rich, as long as you don't forget your loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it.)

（只要不忘记hacker的这种基本的品质就好）

**3.Boredom and drudgery are evil.**

Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it means they aren't doing what only they can do — solve new problems. This wastefulness hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are not just unpleasant but actually evil.

hacker只会做有创造性的工作。

(There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will sometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer as a mind-clearing exercise, or in order to acquire a skill or have some particular kind of experience you can't have otherwise. But this is by choice — nobody who can think should ever be forced into a situation that bores them.)

**4.Freedom is good.**

Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being fascinated by — and, given the way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so. So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, lest it smother you and other hackers.

(This isn't the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to get something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that's a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not on offer.)

Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing — they only like ‘cooperation’ that they control. So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief.

被迫接受一些命令，并且放弃自己所迷恋的问题是有限度的。

**5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.**

To be a hacker, you have to develop some of these attitudes. But copping an attitude alone won't make you a hacker, any more than it will make you a champion athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will take intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.

态度不能取代能力。成为一名hacker同样需要除了态度外的很多别的东西。

If you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself — the hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than drudgery. That attitude is vital to becoming a hacker.

尊重能力。

## Basic Hacking Skills

The hacker attitude is vital, but skills are even more vital. Attitude is no substitute for competence, and there's a certain basic toolkit of skills which you have to have before any hacker will dream of calling you one.

态度很重要，技巧更重要。

**1. Learn how to program.**

If you don't know any computer languages, I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners.I think it is probably best to learn C and Lisp first, then Java.

If a language does too much for you, it may be simultaneously a good tool for production and a bad one for learning.It's not only languages that have this problem; web application frameworks like RubyOnRails, CakePHP, Django may make it too easy to reach a superficial sort of understanding that will leave you without resources when you have to tackle a hard problem, or even just debug the solution to an easy one.

如果一个语言为你做了太多的事情，那么这个语言就是一个强大的工具，但是不适合学习。

If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C;  Neither language is a good one to try learning as your first, however. And, actually, the more you can avoid programming in C the more productive you will be.

C is very efficient, and very sparing of your machine's resources. Unfortunately, C gets that efficiency by requiring you to do a lot of low-level management of resources (like memory) by hand. All that low-level code is complex and bug-prone, and will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging. With today's machines as powerful as they are, this is usually a bad tradeoff — it's smarter to use a language that uses the machine's time less efficiently, but your time much *more* efficiently. Thus, Python.

C语言对于机器来说是很高效的，但对于程序员来说就效率太低了。最好能选择一个对人来说高效的语言——Python.

Other languages of particular importance to hackers include [Perl](http://www.perl.com/) and [LISP](http://www.lisp.org/). Perl is worth learning for practical reasons; it's very widely used for active web pages and system administration, so that even if you never write Perl you should learn to read it. Many people use Perl in the way I suggest you should use Python, to avoid C programming on jobs that don't require C's machine efficiency. You will need to be able to understand their code.

LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot. (You can get some beginning experience with LISP fairly easily by writing and modifying editing modes for the Emacs text editor, or Script-Fu plugins for the GIMP.)

Perl 和LISP也很重要。对于Perl，至少要能读懂它。而LISP则具有很大的启蒙意义。

It's best, actually, to learn all five of Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP. Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways.

最好学会所有者五种语言。

But be aware that you won't reach the skill level of a hacker or even merely a programmer simply by accumulating languages — you need to learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language. To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know. This means you should learn several very different languages.

hacker的编程能力是独立于语言之外的。

**I can't give complete instructions on how to learn to program here — it's a complex skill. But I can tell you that books and courses won't do it — many, maybe *most* of the best hackers are self-taught. You can learn language features — bits of knowledge — from books, but the mind-set that makes that knowledge into living skill can be learned only by practice and apprenticeship. What will do it is (a) *reading code* and (b) *writing code*.**

书本和课程并不能教会编程技巧。读写代码才是真正的方法。

[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language. The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form, write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of strength and economy you see in your models.

多看一些大师的代码，然后写一些东西。
